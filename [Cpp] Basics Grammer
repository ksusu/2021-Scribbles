# [C++] Basic Grammar

### Introduction

This is basic grammar books for me **(ksusu)**.

I thought I learn quite much about the *C++*, but it erase from my head in an instant moment. This is my **reminder** of *C++*.

## Environment for C++

### Offline
I usually used the **IDE** for developing some kinds of little project.

- **Visual Studio 2020**
