# [C++] Basic Grammar

### Introduction

This is basic grammar books for me **(ksusu)**.

I thought I learn quite much about the *C++*, but it erase from my head in an instant moment. This is my **reminder** of *C++*.

## Environment for C++

### Offline
I usually used the **IDE** for developing some kinds of little project.

- **[Visual Studio (2019)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ko/)**
	- This IDE is one of the awesome IDE I ever use. It is fast and convinient for use. But it is quite heavy program and it is suitable for big project.

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ko/)**
	- This is not an IDE but rather than similar with the sublime code highlighter. But with the various modules, it is played like just as a IDE. This is much simple (because basically code highlighter) and good looking
	
	Other things: Eclipses, Notepad++, Sublime, code-blocks

### Online

I don't prefer online environment because this is quite uncomfortable to use and user setting can be differed by computers. But online environment is powerful when I cannot use my own computers. This is now.

	- Quite simple to use
